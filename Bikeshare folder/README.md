## Bike Share Data Overview
Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.

Thanks to the rise in information technologies, it is easy for a user of the system to access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. These technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used.

## Aims
* Import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics
* Explore the use of Python to compare bike share systems in three major cities in the United states-Chicago, New York City, and Washington.
* Write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

## Brief Description of the Dataset
The datasets randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:

Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:

* Gender
* Birth Year
Note: A bit of data wrangling has been performed by Udacity to condense these files to the above core six columns. The datasets have missing data uncleaned. This is not one of the aims of the project.

## Statistics Computed
Written codes of the following information are in the py file:

#1 Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)

* most common month
* most common day of week
* most common hour of day

#2 Popular stations and trip

* most common start station
* most common end station
* most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

#3 Trip duration

* total travel time
* average travel time

#4 User info

* counts of each user type
* counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
* earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)
