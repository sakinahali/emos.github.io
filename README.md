## Project Description
Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.

Thanks to the rise in information technologies, it is easy for a user of the system to access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. These technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bicycle-sharing systems are used.

This project gives a detailed explanation of how bike users interact with the technological systems and gives a track of the number of bikes used per day.

## Project Overview
* Imported over 1000 data and answered interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics.
* Wrangled the dataset using Python and its packages.
* Explored the use of Python to compare bicycle-share systems in three major cities in the United states-Chicago, New York City, and Washington.
* Wrote a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

## Project Description
A lot of technological improvement has occurred in the medical field,  for instance the ease to book an appointment online without the stress of showing up on days unattended to. The medical appointment gives a flexibility and better Doctor-Patient relationship on days to call in sick. 

This project entails data wrangling and exploratory data analysis of medical appointments in Brazil detecting if patients showed up or not. Over 100k medical appointments were used in the data analysis of this project.

## Project Overview
* Cleaned and wrangled over 110527 rows and 14 columns using Python.
* Detected ratio of gender distribution who are likely to show up on appointments.
* Explored the use of data to compare high-risk diseases and the most demanding number of appointments.
* Plotted a well-detailed visualization showing what factors affects the showing up to medical appointments by patients.
